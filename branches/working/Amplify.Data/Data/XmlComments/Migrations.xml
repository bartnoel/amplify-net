				Executes database various <see cref="Amplify.Data.Migration"/> against the current
				version of the schema in the database.
			</summary>
			<remarks>
				<para>
					The migration runner will attempt to create the database if
					it currently does not exist, then it will attempt to create the
					schema table.
				</para>
				<para>
					The schema table is the same that can be found in the default schema
					that comes with asp.net 2.0 providers named
					&quot;aspnet_SchemaVersions&quot; The &quot;Feature&quot; is store as
					<strong>ApplicationSchema</strong> and even though the version is nvarchar(288)
					the &quot;CompatibleVersion&quot; is stored as an integer.
				</para>
				<para>
					The migration runner will initially include a way to run the
					frameworks aspnet_regsql tool, but hopefully later it will include
					migrations that will be able to easily port from datastore to datastore.
