= Stages  =

The project will obviously have different stages and different deliverables upon each stage. 


= Details =

Prototyping/Alpa - write and test as needed for core functionality. Have the main working pieces in place and hammering out all the core details and pitfalls before moving towards a public presentable version.

This stage is test when appropiate, no documentation as the api is not set in stone, and basically the R & D stage of the project.  

Public Release/CTP - the prototype is stable to be to really start blogging, documenting, testing, and writing samples of code as well as making a feature list similar to what you would use in something like the scrum methodology.

Beta - the documentation is being polished, the examples are being polished, the project is tested heavily.

RTM - release of the code, very well written documentation and code samples as well as ways to extend api to what a name means and why.
